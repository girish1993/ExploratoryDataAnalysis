# Melbourne Drone Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This Repo is a detailed representation of Exploratory Data Analysis. Exploratory Data anlaysis forms the basic foundations of a Data science lifecycle. This analysis is performed on a fictional dataset. This Drone Delivery dataset simulates a package delivery system. However, the dataset has inconsistencies in terms of missing values, syntactical data errors, symentic errors. The objective of this analysis is to find these data inconsistencies using univariate and bivariate graphical methods. The dataset has the following features:

<ul>
    <li>Drone Type</li>
    <li>Post Type</li>
    <li>Package Weight</li>
    <li>Origin Region</li>
    <li>Destination Region</li>
    <li>Journey Distance</li>
    <li>Departure Date</li>
    <li>Departure Time</li>
    <li>Travel Time</li>
    <li>Delivery Time</li>
    <li>Delivery Fare</li>
</ul>

Several grahical plots are made use of to find descrepencies and to to find correlations between the features and the response variable i.e the cost of shipping. The primary objective of this solution is to identify and fix irregularities and errors, A statistical model is used to esitmate the missing values in the <i>Delivery Fare</i> feature. Some of the plots employed in this problem are as follows.

<ul>
    <li>Histograms</li>
    <li>Box-plots</li>
    <li>Scatter Plots</li>
    <li>Linear Regressor plots</li>
</ul>

The jupyter notebook <b>EDA.ipynb</b> has the source code with detailed inline comments and descriptions.

Some examples of the types of EDA performed on the Dataset has been shown below.
